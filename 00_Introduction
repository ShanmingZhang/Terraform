* Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure
  - Cloud-based 
  - Software-based
  - Hardware-based
  - VMs-based
  - Containers-baed

* Configuration files describe to Terraform Job details
  - can be used to manage a single application, or the entire datacenter.
  
* Terraform forcus on the desired state of infrastructure:
  - Translates the configuration files to generate execute plans
  - Execute plans to build the describeed infrastructure that realise the desired state
  - Enable to what changed and create incremental execution plans
  
* Terrafrom can manage components:
  - Low-level components: compute instances, storage, and networking...
  - High-level components: DNS, SaaS, Database, Loadbalancer...
  
  
* Features of Terraform:
  - Infrastructure as Code
    > Infrastructure is described using high-level configruation syntax (declarative code)
    > Infrastructure can be shared and re-used
  - Execution Plans
    > Has a "planning" step to generate an execution plan
  - Resource Graph
    > Builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modifications of any non-dependent resources
    > Masterless mode
  - Change Automation
    > Forcus on the desired state of infrastructure described in configuration files
    > Take account of previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph
    > What and how will be changed and in what order to avoid possible human errors and to realize the desired state of infrastructure
